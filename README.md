# US & UK Pronunciation Dictionaries

These dictionaries are in ARPABET format with stresses. Good for G2P training with tools like [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus) and other projects.

+ The US dictionary is derived from the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary taken from [CMUSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict)'s cmudict repository.
  - The text has been cleaned with # comments and enclosed parenthesis with numbers removed.

+ The UK dictionary is derived from the CELEX Dictionary taken from [ProsodyLab](https://github.com/prosodylab/prosodylab.dictionaries)'s dictionary repository.
  - The CELEX pronunciations of the UK dictionary have been appropriately translated to ARPABET format with stresses in tact.
